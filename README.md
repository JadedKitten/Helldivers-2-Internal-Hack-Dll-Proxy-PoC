## Building 
You don't need to build this in Visual Studio, the most recent versions are posted here: \
https://github.com/emoisback/Helldivers-2-Internal-Hack-Dll-Proxy-PoC/actions \
Because github automatically builds the master branch, you can:
- Fork the repository. 
- Go to the Actions tab and make sure workflow is enabled.
- Make any changes to a file, and github will rebuild the .dll in the Actions tab of that fork.

For example: [https://github.com/DeathWrench/Helldivers-2-Internal-Hack-Dll-Proxy-PoC/actions](https://github.com/emoisback/Helldivers-2-Internal-Hack-Dll-Proxy-PoC/actions) \
As you can see, commits from forks get built by github as long as they're in the master branch.
#### Still if you want to build it yourself in Visual Studio:
